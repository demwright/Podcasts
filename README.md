# Podcasts
Some of the podcasts I listen to frequently and maybe my thoughts on episodes.

## [Hard Fork](https://open.spotify.com/show/44fllCS2FTFr2x2kjP9xeT?si=54be5ff48eab4752)
I like this podcast to stay up to date with recent tech news. I find Casey and Kevin to be entertaining as well as informative. They have decent conenctions in the tech world and are very pro-journalism. 
## [The Ezra Klein Show](https://open.spotify.com/show/3oB5noYIwEB2dMAREj2F7S?si=8bc6dd3831334213)
I like this podcast to hear interesting perspectives on geopolitics and self-help topics. I think Ezra's questions for his well-educated guests make him standout as an interviewer. 
## [Intelligence Squared](https://open.spotify.com/show/7gnNY9Fy8QSRbjXZ00A9jW?si=78c433c133084832)
I like this podcast to learn about a variety of topics like history, geopolitics, politics, and hear people debate. 
## [Lex Fridman Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/2MAi0BvDc6GTFvKFPXnkCL?si=a592686e4d474989)
I like this podcast to make influential people more human. He tries to let opposing viewpoints get the podium. These episodes are several hours so which I like because we can get a below-surface-level understanding of people and their views. 
## [Left, Right & Center](https://open.spotify.com/show/21X49oNQyL8c6GKmgzjnmo?si=83b7c1c7feda4797)
I like this podcast to understand the perspective of different lawyers and their take on current legal policies. 
## [IMF Podcasts](https://open.spotify.com/show/2stM36FW9kDwybHetyFqpA?si=df4bf9ac138f4ecf)
I like this podcast to hear global economists talk about their research.
## Extras
These are some episodes produced by people whom I do not listen to consistently.
