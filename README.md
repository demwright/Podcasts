# Podcasts
Some of the podcasts I listen to frequently and maybe my thoughts on episodes.

## [Hard Fork](./Hard-Fork/)
I like this podcast to stay up to date with recent tech news. I find Casey and Kevin to be entertaining as well as informative. They have decent conenctions in the tech world and are very pro-journalism. 
## [The Ezra Klein Show](./The-Ezra-Klein-Show/)
I like this podcast to hear interesting perspectives on geopolitics and self-help topics. I think Ezra's questions for his well-educated guests make him standout as an interviewer. 
## [Intelligence Squared](./Intelligence-Squared)
I like this podcast to learn about a variety of topics like history, geopolitics, politics, and hear people debate. 
## [Lex Fridman Podcast](./Lex-Fridman-Podcast)
I like this podcast to make influential people more human. He tries to let opposing viewpoints get the podium. These episodes are several hours so which I like because we can get a below-surface-level understanding of people and their views. 
## [Left, Right & Center](./Left-Right-Center)
I like this podcast to understand the perspective of different lawyers and their take on current legal policies. 
## [IMF Podcasts](./IMF-Podcasts)
I like this podcast to hear global economists talk about their research.
## Extras
These are some episodes produced by people whom I do not listen to consistently.
